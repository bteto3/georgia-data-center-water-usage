# Summer-Research
TODO:
* Scrape the relevant data from the DRI submissions webpage
  - https://apps.dca.ga.gov/DRI/Submissions.aspx
* Clean the data and process into a CSV
* Save this data locally
* Send the CSV to an email list 
  - Initially this can just be you and me
  - Make the subject constant so it can be parsed by email filters
  - Optional: Automatically highlight changes in the CSV values
